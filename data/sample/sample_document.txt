RAG Chatbot Documentation

What is RAG?
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. It allows AI systems to access and use information from external sources, making responses more accurate and up-to-date.

How RAG Works:
1. Document Processing: Documents are broken down into smaller chunks and converted into vector embeddings
2. Storage: These embeddings are stored in a vector database for efficient retrieval
3. Query Processing: When a user asks a question, the system converts it to an embedding
4. Retrieval: The system finds the most relevant document chunks based on similarity
5. Generation: The LLM generates a response using the retrieved context

Benefits of RAG:
- Improved accuracy through access to current information
- Reduced hallucination by grounding responses in real data
- Ability to handle domain-specific knowledge
- Cost-effective compared to fine-tuning large models

Common Use Cases:
- Customer support chatbots
- Research assistants
- Document Q&A systems
- Knowledge base management
- Educational tools

Technical Components:
- Vector Database: Chroma, FAISS, Pinecone
- Embedding Models: Sentence transformers, OpenAI embeddings
- Language Models: GPT, Claude, Gemini, local models
- Document Processors: PDF, DOCX, TXT parsers

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate chunk sizes (500-1000 tokens)
- Implement proper text preprocessing
- Choose relevant embedding models
- Monitor retrieval quality
- Regular knowledge base updates
